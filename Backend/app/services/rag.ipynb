When you look up a phone number in the phone book and remember it long enough to make the call, you’re using working memory. When your spouse asks you to do something and you say, “I’ll do it as soon as I finish loading the dishwasher,” and then you actually remember to do it, chances are your working memory is pretty good. Odds are it’s not so good, however, if you can’t remember anyone’s birthday, you tend to return home with only half your errands done unless you have a written agenda, and you’ll do anything to avoid having to introduce people at a cocktail party because you can’t remember anyone’s name. In that case, be sure to use the tips in Chapter 3 to help you enhance your child’s working memory when you have the same weakness.', 'How Working Memory Develops Working memory begins to develop fairly early in infancy. When you’re playing with a baby and you hide a favorite toy under a blanket, you know the baby is using working memory if he lifts the blanket to retrieve the toy. This is because the baby is able to hold an image of the toy in mind as well as the memory of what you did to hide it. Children develop nonverbal working memory before they develop verbal working memory because this skill begins to emerge before language does. When children develop language, however, their working memory skills expand, because now they can draw on visual imagery and language to retrieve information. As we told you in Chapter 1, when children and teenagers perform tasks that require executive skills such as working memory, they rely on the prefrontal cortex to do all the work rather than distributing the workload to other specialized regions of the brain, as adults are able to do. Thus, activating working memory takes more conscious effort with children and with teenagers than it does with adults, which may help explain why they are less inclined to use their working memory to complete daily routine tasks. We tend naturally to limit our expectations for working memory in very young children. Before the age of 3, we generally expect children to remember only things that are in close proximity—either in time or in space. If we want them to do something, we don’t say, “Would you mind putting your toys away after you finish watchingBarney ?” (unless we also expect to cue them once Barney is over).

It’s an ability to observe how you problem solve. It also includes self-monitoring and self-evaluating—asking yourself, “How am I doing?” or “How did I do?” Adults who have this skill can size up a problem situation, take into account multiple pieces of information, and make good decisions about how to proceed. They can also evaluate afterward how they did and decide to do things differently in the future if need be. Adults who lack this skill may miss or ignore important information (particularly social cues) and tend to make decisions based on “what feels right” rather than careful analysis of the facts. If you feel like you put your foot in your mouth a lot, make decisions you regret, and can’t always get a handle on how well you’re doing in your endeavors, follow the procedure suggested in Chapter 3 for helping your child learn a skill that isn’t your strong suit either. How Metacognition Develops Metacognition is a complex set of skills that begins developing during the first year of life as infants work to organize their experiences, by sorting and classifying and by starting to recognize cause–effect relationships. These skills get extended during toddlerhood, when order, routine, and ritual—all mechanisms whereby they can control their experiences—become important to kids. By preschool, the emphasis shifts from exploration to mastery. At this age, children begin to recognize that other people have different perceptual experiences, and they begin to identify emotions in others and to be able to role-play. Shortly after that, between the ages of and 7, children begin to recognize that others have different thoughts and feelings, and they start being able to make rudimentary interpretations of intent (such as whether someone hurt them on purpose or by accident). By middle childhood, the metacognitive vista widens dramatically. Children at this age not only have a deeper understanding of their own thoughts, feelings, and intentions, but they understand that their thoughts, feelings, and intentions can be the object of the thinking of others. This is why youngsters in middle school develop such self-consciousness about their own actions and why conformity becomes such a priority for many. They have not yet learned that just because other people canthink about them in a way that may seem intrusive doesn’t mean they are! By high school, they can step back and put things in a little more perspective, as the building blocks of metacognition accumulate and fall into place.

      "['Enhancing Working Memory Working memory is the capacity to hold information in mind while performing complex tasks. We rely on working memory all the time. It’s the ability to run out to the store to buy a few things and remember what they are without having to write them down. When you remember to stop by the dry cleaner on your way home from work, you’re using working memory. When you look up a phone number in the phone book and remember it long enough to make the call, you’re using working memory. When your spouse asks you to do something and you say, “I’ll do it as soon as I finish loading the dishwasher,” and then you actually remember to do it, chances are your working memory is pretty good. Odds are it’s not so good, however, if you can’t remember anyone’s birthday, you tend to return home with only half your errands done unless you have a written agenda, and you’ll do anything to avoid having to introduce people at a cocktail party because you can’t remember anyone’s name. In that case, be sure to use the tips in Chapter 3 to help you enhance your child’s working memory when you have the same weakness.', 'How Working Memory Develops Working memory begins to develop fairly early in infancy. When you’re playing with a baby and you hide a favorite toy under a blanket, you know the baby is using working memory if he lifts the blanket to retrieve the toy. This is because the baby is able to hold an image of the toy in mind as well as the memory of what you did to hide it. Children develop nonverbal working memory before they develop verbal working memory because this skill begins to emerge before language does. When children develop language, however, their working memory skills expand, because now they can draw on visual imagery and language to retrieve information. As we told you in Chapter 1, when children and teenagers perform tasks that require executive skills such as working memory, they rely on the prefrontal cortex to do all the work rather than distributing the workload to other specialized regions of the brain, as adults are able to do. Thus, activating working memory takes more conscious effort with children and with teenagers than it does with adults, which may help explain why they are less inclined to use their working memory to complete daily routine tasks. We tend naturally to limit our expectations for working memory in very young children. Before the age of 3, we generally expect children to remember only things that are in close proximity—either in time or in space. If we want them to do something, we don’t say, “Would you mind putting your toys away after you finish watchingBarney ?” (unless we also expect to cue them once Barney is over). And while we might ask them to put all their blocks in the toy box while we’re standing in the playroom with them, we generally don’t instruct them to go to their bedroom and do a similar task all by themselves. Gradually, we’re able to stretch both time and distance in terms of what we expect our children to be able to remember. In the questionnaire below, you can evaluate where your child might fall on the developmental ladder, based on the kinds of tasks children are capable of carrying out independently at various childhood stages. Using this scale will give you a closer look than the scales in Chapter did at how well your child uses the skill of working memory. HOW GOOD ISYOUR CHILD’SWORKING MEMORY? Use the following scale to rate how well your child performs e ach of the tasks listed. At each level, children can be expected to perform all the tasks listed fairly well to very well.

Copyright 2009 by The Guilfo rd Press.', 'Cultivating Metacognition Metacognition refers to the ability to stand back and take a bird’s-eye view of oneself in a situation. It’s an ability to observe how you problem solve. It also includes self-monitoring and self-evaluating—asking yourself, “How am I doing?” or “How did I do?” Adults who have this skill can size up a problem situation, take into account multiple pieces of information, and make good decisions about how to proceed. They can also evaluate afterward how they did and decide to do things differently in the future if need be. Adults who lack this skill may miss or ignore important information (particularly social cues) and tend to make decisions based on “what feels right” rather than careful analysis of the facts. If you feel like you put your foot in your mouth a lot, make decisions you regret, and can’t always get a handle on how well you’re doing in your endeavors, follow the procedure suggested in Chapter 3 for helping your child learn a skill that isn’t your strong suit either. How Metacognition Develops Metacognition is a complex set of skills that begins developing during the first year of life as infants work to organize their experiences, by sorting and classifying and by starting to recognize cause–effect relationships. These skills get extended during toddlerhood, when order, routine, and ritual—all mechanisms whereby they can control their experiences—become important to kids. By preschool, the emphasis shifts from exploration to mastery. At this age, children begin to recognize that other people have different perceptual experiences, and they begin to identify emotions in others and to be able to role-play. Shortly after that, between the ages of and 7, children begin to recognize that others have different thoughts and feelings, and they start being able to make rudimentary interpretations of intent (such as whether someone hurt them on purpose or by accident). By middle childhood, the metacognitive vista widens dramatically. Children at this age not only have a deeper understanding of their own thoughts, feelings, and intentions, but they understand that their thoughts, feelings, and intentions can be the object of the thinking of others. This is why youngsters in middle school develop such self-consciousness about their own actions and why conformity becomes such a priority for many. They have not yet learned that just because other people canthink about them in a way that may seem intrusive doesn’t mean they are! By high school, they can step back and put things in a little more perspective, as the building blocks of metacognition accumulate and fall into place. To assess how your child’s metacognitive skills compare with his age group, complete the questionnaire below, which builds on the assessment you did of your child in Chapter 2.

One set involves the child’s ability to evaluate her performance on a task, such as a chore or a homework assignment, and to make changes based on that evaluation. The second set involves the child’s ability to evaluate social situations—both her own behavior and others’ reactions and the behavior of others. To help your child develop skills related to task performance, try the following: •Provide specific praise for key elements of task performance. For instance, if you want to teach your child to be thorough in completing a task, praise him for that: “I like the way you put every single block back in the box” or “I like the way you looked under your bed to see if there were any dirty clothes there.” •Teach your child to evaluate her own performance on a task. After finishing her spelling homework where the assignment was to write each spelling word in a sentence, you might ask, “How do you think you did?', 'Fostering Organization Organization refers to the ability to establish and maintain a system for arranging or keeping track of important items. For us adults the benefits of organizational abilities are pretty obvious.

Better yet, make it a checklist, so the child can check off each step as it’s completed. •Involve your child as much as possible in the planning process once you’ve been providing models for a while. Ask, “What do you need to do first? And then what?” and so on and write down each step as the child dictates it to you. •Use things the child wants as a jumping-off point for teaching planning skills. Children are likely more willing to make the effort to devise a plan to build a tree house than they might be to plan how to clean their closets, but the same principles apply in both cases. •Prompt prioritizing by asking your child what needs to get done first. Ask questions like “What’s the most important thing you have to do today?” You can also force this issue by withholding preferred activities until after the priorities are done (for example, “You can watch television when your homework is done” or “You can play video games once you’ve loaded the dishwasher”).
