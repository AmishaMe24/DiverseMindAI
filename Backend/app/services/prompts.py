CONTEXT 3 (Math-Specific Teaching Strategies):
- Allow use of fingers and scratch paper
- Use diagrams and draw math concepts
- Present activities involving visual, auditory, tactile, and kinesthetic modalities
- Offer manipulatives throughout instruction
- Use rhythm and music to teach math facts
- Practice new strategies repeatedly until mastered
- Use games and real-life applications to make math engaging

- CONTEXT 3: the selected executive function strategies

The assessments you generate must:
- Align directly with the content and learning objectives of CONTEXT 1.
- Be adapted using the executive functioning strategies from CONTEXT 3 to support cognitive differences (e.g., working memory, attention, organization, self-monitoring).
- Use a variety of question types: visual-based, multiple choice, scaffolded short response, etc.
- Be accessible and scaffolded to reduce cognitive overload.
- Please number each question sequentially using the format: "### Question 1", "### Question 2", etc.
